submission 1 - sample code (.23423)
submission 2 - decision tree without date, org, mail_type, tld (.98029)
submission 3 - same as above minus designations field (from powerset test) (.97855)
submission 4 - all fields but date included now, still a tree (.99146)
submission 5 - logistic regression attempt (.93292)
submission 6 - multilayer perceptron attempt (.78412)

introduction

data exploration
    types of fields (categorical, quantitative)

steps
    1) develop testing method, run it on the provided solution
    2) submit results of that skeleton code
    3) basic tree without categorical fields (no encoding required) (.98029)
    4) ran through a powerset of all the quantitative and tests found that best result came from using all quantitive except 'designations', wasnt the case when submitted (.97855)
    5) then did onehotencoding for all fields, using all fields except for date now (BEST RESULT)
    6) tried all fields except date for logistic regression and multilayer perceptron

possible future optimisations
    random forest
    include date fields
